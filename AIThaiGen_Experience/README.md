# AIThaiGen
[AIThaiGen](https://aithaigen.in.th/) is an engaging AI learning platform ðŸŽ“ designed to teach coding and artificial intelligence in a simple way. The project is led by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Panrasee Ritthipravat, a faculty member in my department.

My experience with the platform was remarkable, as it provided an easy-to-understand overview of how AI works.
All class exercises are conveniently stored in the [Example](https://github.com/kaoqueri/Milly-Learning_Journey/tree/main/AIThaiGen_Experience/Example) section.
