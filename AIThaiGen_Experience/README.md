# AIThaiGen
[AIThaiGen](https://aithaigen.in.th/) is an AI learning platform ðŸŽ“ designed to teach coding and artificial intelligence skills in a simple and engaging way. It is leaded by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Panrasee Ritthipravat, a faculty in my department.

My experience with AIThaiGen was remarkable. It really gave the easy-to-understand overview idea of how AI works.
In [Example](https://github.com/kaoqueri/Milly-Learning_Journey/tree/main/AIThaiGen_Experience/Example), all the class exercises is stored.
